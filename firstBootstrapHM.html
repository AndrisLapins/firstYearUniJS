                <h2>CSS</h2>
                <p class="text-justify"><i>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</i> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
                

                <p class="text-justify">CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The CSS specifications are maintained by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</a>. Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service for CSS documents.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Improving web presentation capabilities was a topic of interest to many in the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list. Of these nine proposals, two were especially influential on what became CSS: Cascading HTML Style Sheets and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal (SSP). Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals; Lie worked with Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett's Arena browser. Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser. Thereafter, Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard (the 'H' was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML).</p>

                <h3 id="syntax">Syntax</h3>
                CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties. A style sheet consists of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.

                <h3 id="selector">Selector</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">In CSS, selectors declare which part of the markup a style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.</p>

                <p>Selectors may apply to:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>all elements of a specific type, e.g. the second-level headers h2</li>
                    <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>id: an identifier unique within the document</li>
                        <li>class: an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in a document</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li>
                </ul>    
                <p class="text-justify">Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of a widely used pseudo-class is <code>:hover</code>, which identifies content only when the user “points to” the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in <code>a:hover</code> or <code>#elementid:hover</code>. A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as <code>:link</code> or <code>:visited</code>, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that may consist of partial elements, such as <code>::first-line</code> or <code>::first-letter</code>.</p>
                
                <p class="text-justify">The following table provides a summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that introduced it.</p>

                <h3 id="use">Use</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Before CSS, nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors, background styles, element alignments, borders and sizes had to be explicitly described, often repeatedly, within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file, the style sheet, resulting in considerably simpler HTML.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Before CSS, document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to, say, all h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex, larger, and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color, font, text alignment, size, borders, spacing, layout and many other typographic characteristics, and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles, such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">The advantages of this may not be immediately clear (since the second form is actually more verbose), but the power of CSS becomes more apparent when the style properties are placed in an internal style element or, even better, an external CSS file. For example, suppose the document contains the style element:</p>               

    <xmp><style>
    h1 {color: red;}
</style></xmp>

                <p class="text-justify">All <code>h1</code> elements in the document will then automatically become red without requiring any explicit code. If the author later wanted to make <code>h1</code> elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the style element to:</p> 

    <xmp><style>
    h1 {color: blue;}
</style></xmp> 
    
                <p class="text-justify">rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual <code>h1</code> element.</p>
                
                <!--<pre>
                    <style>
                        h1 {color: red;}
                    </style>
                    All h1 elements in the document will then automatically become red without requiring any explicit code. If the author later wanted to make h1 elements blue instead, this could be done by changing the style element to:
                    
                    <style>
                        h1 {color: blue;}
                    </style>

                <h3 id="limitations">Limitations</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Some noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include:</p>

                <b>Selectors are unable to ascend</b>
                <p class="text-justify">CSS currently offers no way to select a parent or ancestor of an element that satisfies certain criteria. CSS Selectors Level 4, which is still in Working Draft status, proposes such a selector, but only as part of the "complete" selector profile, not the "fast" profile used in dynamic CSS styling. A more advanced selector scheme (such as XPath) would enable more sophisticated style sheets. The major reasons for the CSS Working Group previously rejecting proposals for parent selectors are related to browser performance and incremental rendering issues.</p>
                
                <b>Cannot explicitly declare new scope independently of position</b>
                <p class="text-justify">Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the closest parent element with a position:absolute or position:relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired effects. For example, it is impossible to avoid declaring a new scope when one is forced to adjust an element's position, preventing one from using the desired scope of a parent element.</p>
                <b>Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable</b>
                <p>CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user feedback by conditional application of alternate styles. One CSS pseudo-class, "<code>:hover</code>", is dynamic (equivalent of JavaScript "onmouseover") and has potential for abuse (e.g., implementing cursor-proximity popups), but CSS has no ability for a client to disable it (no "disable"-like property) or limit its effects (no "nochange"-like values for each property).</p>
                <b>Cannot name rules</b>
                <p class="text-justify">There is no way to name a CSS rule, which would allow (for example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its selector changes.</p>
                <b>Cannot target specific text without altering markup</b>
                <p class="text-justify">Besides the <code>:first-letter</code> pseudo-element, one cannot target specific ranges of text without needing to utilize place-holder elements.</p>
